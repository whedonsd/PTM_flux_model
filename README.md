# Histone PTM Flux Model

A Python toolkit for representing histone post-translational modification (PTM) states as a graph, detecting adjacency between states, and inferring probable **fluxes** (transitions) between them from observed changes in abundance over time.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

1. **Nodes**: Represent histone PTM states as nodes in a graph.
   - Each node corresponds to a unique string (e.g., `H3K9me1 + H3K14ac`).
   - Each node carries **abundance values** at multiple time points.

2. **Edges**: Automatically detect edges between nodes that differ by exactly **one modification**.
   - Example: `H3K9me1` â†” `H3K9me2`.
   - Must also handle adjacency between modified and unmodified states (e.g., `K9me1` â†” `""`).

3. **Flux Inference**: Estimate probable fluxes between nodes.
   - Based on observed changes in node abundances (`t0 â†’ t1`).
   - Modeled as a **sparse system of linear equations** with conservation of weight.
   - Solved using **linear programming**.

4. **Scalability**: Handle 150â€“300 nodes with thousands of edges.
   - Exploit sparsity for performance.
   - Export intermediate results for manual inspection.
